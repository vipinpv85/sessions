  a. PrintUsage: add dpdk support information
  b. RegisterAllModules: add DPDK receive and decode therads
  c. ParseInterfacesList: if runmode is DPDK fetch and check for DPDK interfaces
  d. ParseCommandLine: add option for runmode dpdk and listdpdkports
  e. main: 
    i. parse YAML for DPDK-SURICATA configuration
    ii. check for pre filter ACL and create if necessary
    iii. check for pre reassembly and create if necesasry
    iv. validate user configuration
    v. set the run mode based on YAML DPDK config
    vi. cleanup DPDK instance if runmode is activated as DPDK
